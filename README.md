PathPlus
</h1>
<p align="center">
PathPlus is a library made for GameMaker to expand the possibilities of Paths.
</p>

Current features include:

- Transform a linear path into a Catmull-Rom curve (smoothly passes through all control points)
- Transform a linear path into a Bezier curve (higer control with curve handles, can combine sharp and smooth corners)
- Add extra variables to a point
- Bake the resulting curve into a path asset or export it as a .yy to use in your projects

Implemented examples include:

- A lasso tool that allows you to select instances or arrays of coordinates.
- A recorder that creates a path from your mouse movement, storing the relative speeds.
- A (rough) path editor.

Other possibilities include:

- Alter path-finding curves to be more varied or smooth.
- Please notice PathPlus is still a work in progress :)
